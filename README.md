# Implementing-a-dropout-in-recurrent-neural-networks
This assignment consists of two parts:  1) the use of a recurrent network to solve the problem of text classification. More specifically, predicting the rating of a movie's review. 2) the simplest linguistic model for generating text based on LSTM.  While completing the task, we learned LSTM with different levels of "boxiness", and also got acquainted with various ways of applying DropOut to recurrent architectures. In recurrent architectures, there are much more options for imposing a binary noise mask than in forward-pass neural networks.  In the second part, you will try to implement the simplest recursive decoder for generating texts.
